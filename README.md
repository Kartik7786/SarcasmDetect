### Title: SarcasmDetect

Description: Based on sarcastic (The Onion) and non-sarcastic headlines (HuffPost), the system would help in sarcastic headline awareness and detection. We are diving into sarcastic commentary to see if we can predict sarcasm in a headline.

Goal: This will help improve a userâ€™s ability to detect what is sarcastic or not. This will work alongside traditional NLP algorithms that are trained to understand the non-sarcastic language around business communication. 

Tech stack: 
* Kaggle dataset (json)
* Python (ML frameworks like sklearn) 
* Data visualization (QlikView/Tableau)
* To be determined

Notes :- If you can bring NER to pin point people, product or processes for sarcasm detection then it will be useful. Provide actionable insights based on NER so for ex. If you discover 50% sarcasm in the headlines / tweets about new samsung fold phone then samsung can learn a lot with further insight you provide on the article using NLP
