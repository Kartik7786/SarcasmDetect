Project Idea #1

Title: Do you have heart stroke risk?

Description: With real-time data from smart monitoring devices, a system would predict and send out real-time notifications containing causes and suggestions. 
The goal of the project: This will help millions of people who are interested in real-time feedback on their lifestyle choices. 

Technology stack:
Kaggle dataset (csv)
Python (ML frameworks like sklearn)
Data visualization (QlikView/Tableau)
Microservices using SpringBoot
To be determined


Project Idea #2

Title: Run your home better

Description: Based on data from various IoT devices and weather patterns, we will send the homeowners notifications on effective home energy conservation.

Goal: This will help every homeowner save money and help reduce carbon footprint.

Tech stack: 
Kaggle dataset (csv)
Python (ML frameworks like sklearn) 
Data visualization (QlikView/Tableau)
To be determined

Project Idea #3

Title: Is this sarcasm?

Description: Based on sarcastic (The Onion) and non-sarcastic headlines (HuffPost), the system would help in sarcastic headline awareness and detection. We are diving into sarcastic commentary to see if we can predict sarcasm in a headline.

Goal: This will help improve a userâ€™s ability to detect what is sarcastic or not. This will work alongside traditional NLP algorithms that are trained to understand the non-sarcastic language around business communication. 

Tech stack: 
Kaggle dataset (json)
Python (ML frameworks like sklearn) 
Data visualization (QlikView/Tableau)
To be determined
